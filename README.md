Game Mechanics:
    Slider Control:
        A slider is provided on the platform, allowing you to control the exact size of the cut.
        As you move the slider, it dynamically adjusts the area of the object to be slashed, helping you achieve the target percentage.

    Percentage-Based Cutting:
        Each level presents an object with a specific percentage requirement. For example, if the requirement is 30%, you must use the slider to slash off exactly 30% of the object.

    Feedback System:
        After making your cut, the game provides feedback on how accurately you matched the required percentage.
        The closer your cut is to the target, the higher your score.

    Variety of Challenges:
        Objects vary in shape and complexity, ranging from simple geometric figures to more intricate designs, making each level progressively more challenging.

Winning the Game:

    Level Completion: To complete a level, you must accurately slash the object based on the given percentage using the slider. The goal is to stay within a small margin of error to achieve the perfect cut.

Tips for Success:

    Careful Adjustment: Move the slider slowly and precisely to ensure that your slash matches the target percentage.
    Practice: Familiarizing yourself with how the slider affects different shapes will help you become more precise over time.

Slash is a game of precision and control, testing your ability to make accurate cuts by carefully adjusting the slider.
